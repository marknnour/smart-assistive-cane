# Assistive Robot Cane

## Overview
The Assistive Robot Cane is a smart assistive tool designed for individuals with visual impairments. By leveraging the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, the cane is able to actively sense its environment and compute optimal paths, ensuring the user is guided safely to their destination while dynamically avoiding obstacles.

## About the Project

The Assistive Robot Cane was developed during the SoNIC Summer Research Workshop hosted by Cornell University. This workshop provided a deep dive into the world of Robotics and Assistive Technology.

We were privileged to learn about the commendable work that Professor Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee and his lab are doing in the field of assistive technology, especially their efforts directed towards aiding individuals with mobility disabilities. Our exposure ranged from an introduction to the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, to hands-on experience with perception motion planning and control. This experience was invaluable and rich in knowledge, introducing us to cutting-edge advancements in the field.

Throughout this workshop, my team and I dedicated our efforts to build the smart assistive cane, designed with a primary focus on aiding individuals with visual impairments. The cane's capability to sense the environment and calculate the optimal path for users, even in the presence of dynamic obstacles, stands testament to the potential of robotics in making a positive impact in the world.




## Our Journey ðŸš€

From concept to prototype, our journey of designing the Robot Cane was both challenging and fulfilling. The final product stands as a testament to the transformative potential of robotics in enhancing the quality of life for many.

Key capabilities of the cane include:
-Use the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework to build a robot application
-Perform state estimation using fiducial markers (used ArUco markers)
-Plan robot movements using a graph-based motion planning algorithm (used A Star algorithm)
-Send control signals to a robot that will guide a human user (Used RPi GPIO with ROS messages)
-Understand and integrate various sub-fields of robotics such as state estimation, motion planning, and controls towards developing a smart assistive cane

## Conclusion ðŸŒŸ

This project was truly rewarding, and it showcased the potential of robotics to positively impact the world.
